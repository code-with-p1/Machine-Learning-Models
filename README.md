A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to provide a clear and practical understanding of the four fundamental pillars of Machine Learning. This repository serves as a learning path for beginners and a reference for enthusiasts to explore core concepts using the classic, beginner-friendly datasets from `scikit-learn`.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

This repository is organized into four key sections, each dedicated to a specific type of machine learning problem. Each section contains a Jupyter notebook with explanations, code, and visualizations.

| ML Type | Description | Key Models Explored | Datasets Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📊 Classification** | Predicting discrete categories (e.g., spam or not spam). | `LogisticRegression`, `SVC`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier` | `load_iris()`, `load_wine()`, `load_breast_cancer()`, `make_classification()` |
| **📈 Regression** | Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices). | `LinearRegression`, `Ridge`, `SVR`, `RandomForestRegressor` | `load_diabetes()`, `fetch_california_housing()`, `make_regression()` |
| **🔍 Clustering** | Finding hidden patterns and groupings in unlabeled data. | `KMeans`, `DBSCAN`, `AgglomerativeClustering` | `make_blobs()`, `make_moons()`, `load_iris()` (ignore labels) |
| **📉 Dimensionality Reduction** | Simplifying data while preserving its structure for visualization and efficiency. | `PCA`, `t-SNE`, `NMF`, `TruncatedSVD` | `load_digits()`, `load_iris()`, `fetch_olivetti_faces()` |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**
*   Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn` (optional)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/code-with-p1/Machine-Learning-Models.git
    cd Machine-Learning-Models
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv ml-env
    # On Windows
    ml-env\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source ml-env/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, install manually:*
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter seaborn
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open any of the four notebooks from the launched browser window.

## 🧪 How to Use This Repository

1.  **Start with Classification or Regression:** If you are new to ML, begin with the supervised learning notebooks (Classification or Regression). They provide the most intuitive introduction.
2.  **Run Code Cells:** Execute the code cells in order to see the output and visualizations.
3.  **Experiment:** Don't just run the code—modify it! Change model parameters (e.g., `n_estimators` in Random Forest, `n_clusters` in K-Means) and see how the results change.
4.  **Understand the Output:** Pay attention to the evaluation metrics (Accuracy, MSE, R² Score) and what the visualizations are telling you about the model's performance.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

After exploring these notebooks, you will understand:
*   The practical difference between **Supervised** and **Unsupervised** learning.
*   How to implement, train, and evaluate multiple ML models for a given task.
*   The importance of choosing the right model and tuning its parameters.
*   How to use dimensionality reduction for both visualization and data preprocessing.
*   The value of using well-established datasets to benchmark and compare algorithms.
